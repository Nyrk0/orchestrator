# Orch Core Methodology

**Essential knowledge for the orch subagent to accomplish orchestrator role in an empowered manner**

## Core Principles

### Specification-Driven Development Philosophy
Transform chaotic "agile" development (single-prompt-shot vibe-coding and non-interactive spec-kit approaches) into **systematic, specification-driven workflows** through:

1. **Interactive User Interviews** - Collaborative requirement gathering
2. **Intelligent Suggestions** - Context-aware recommendations and alternatives
3. **Approval Gates** - Explicit user validation between phases
4. **Sequential Progression** - Enforced workflow order ensuring quality

### The Five-Phase Methodology

#### Phase 1: üìã SPECIFICATION
**Objective**: Define comprehensive requirements, constraints, and success criteria

**Process**:
- **Initiate with "What, Why, How"**: Start the interview by establishing the core foundation:
    - **What** are we building? (The scope)
    - **Why** are we building it? (The value)
    - **How** will we measure success? (The acceptance criteria)
- **Gather Details**: Based on the "What, Why, How" framework, conduct a deeper interactive interview to gather detailed objectives, requirements, dependencies, and constraints.
- **Provide Alternatives**: Offer alternative approaches with pros/cons comparisons for major decisions.
- **Generate Document**: Create the complete specification document.
- **Approval Gate**: User must explicitly approve before research

**Key Principles**:
- Ask targeted questions that reveal true requirements
- Suggest common patterns and best practices
- Offer 2-3 relevant alternatives for major decisions
- Validate completeness and coherence

#### Phase 2: üî¨ RESEARCH
**Objective**: Conduct technical analysis with validated sources and best practices

**Process**:
- Web search for current best practices and documentation
- Analyze technical approaches and alternatives
- Validate sources and provide citations with dates
- Research dependencies and integration requirements
- **Approval Gate**: User must approve research findings

**Research Depth Levels**:
- **Quick**: Basic patterns and common approaches
- **Thorough**: Comprehensive analysis with multiple sources
- **Expert**: Deep technical investigation with experiments
- **User Escalation**: When research reveals complex decisions

#### Phase 3: üìê PLANNING
**Objective**: Create implementation architecture and execution strategies

**Process**:
- Design system architecture based on approved research
- Break down into logical components and modules
- Define file structure and implementation approach
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- **Approval Gate**: User must approve implementation plan

**Planning Elements**:
- Architecture overview and design patterns
- Component breakdown and responsibilities
- File structure and organization
- Integration strategy with existing systems

#### Phase 4: üéØ PRD (Product Requirements Document)
**Objective**: Define Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with semantic analysis

**Process**:
- **Semantic Analysis**: Analyze approved specification and plan content
- **Feature Prioritization**: Intelligently suggest MVP features based on complexity and impact
- **MVP Definition**: Create focused product definition with clear scope boundaries
- **User Flow Design**: Define core user journey through MVP functionality
- **Success Metrics**: Establish measurable criteria for MVP success
- **Approval Gate**: User must approve PRD before task breakdown

**PRD Elements**:
- Single-sentence MVP goal statement
- Prioritized feature matrix (Impact vs Complexity)
- Core user experience flow
- Technical implementation priorities
- Clear out-of-scope boundaries
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Semantic Analysis Features**:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common project patterns from spec/plan
- **Complexity Assessment**: Analyze technical complexity of planned features  
- **Impact Evaluation**: Determine business value and user impact
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand technical and business dependencies
- **Timeline Estimation**: Provide data-driven timeline estimates

#### Phase 5: ‚úÖ TASKS
**Objective**: Generate executable task breakdown with clear dependencies

**Process**:
- Create numbered tasks (T001, T002, T003, etc.)
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Establish dependencies between tasks
- Estimate complexity and effort levels
- **Approval Gate**: User approves task breakdown for implementation

**Task Requirements**:
- Specific, actionable, and measurable
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Proper dependency sequencing
- Implementation-ready detail level

## User Experience System

### Feedback Style Preferences
**First-run Detection**: Check for `orch-states/user-preferences.json`

If not found, conduct style preference interview:

#### 1. **"user-friendly"** (Default)
- Explanatory feedback with detailed reasoning
- Multiple suggestions with alternatives comparison
- Natural language explanations and examples
- "Here's why this approach works well because..."

#### 2. **"professional"**
- Concise, direct feedback
- Essential suggestions only
- Technical focus without elaboration
- "Recommend: X because Y"

#### 3. **"sudo-style"**
- Minimal feedback, maximum efficiency
- No explanatory text unless critical
- User assumed expert-level
- Direct execution with minimal guidance

### Style Application
- Save preference to `orch-states/user-preferences.json`
- Apply consistently across all phase interactions
- Adapt suggestion complexity to user's preferred style
- Maintain style for error reporting and validation feedback

## State Management

### File Structure
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .orchestrator/                    # Tool installation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orch-states/                     # Central state management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phases.json                  # Phase registry and status
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-preferences.json        # User style and settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/                            # Generated documentation
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stXX-name/                  # Phase-specific folders
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md                 # Specification document
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research.md             # Research analysis
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md                 # Implementation plan
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                # Task breakdown
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-state.json        # Detailed workflow state
```

### State Persistence
- **Phase Status**: Track `in_progress`, `approved`, `rejected` for each phase
- **User Preferences**: Maintain feedback style and interview settings
- **Workflow Validation**: Enforce sequential progression
- **Cross-session Continuity**: Maintain state across command invocations

## Command Execution Pattern

### Bash Tool Integration
**Critical**: Always use Bash tool to execute orchestrator commands:

```bash
cd /path/to/.orchestrator && node cli.js <command> <phase> [options]
```

### Available Commands
- **spec**: Interactive specification generation
- **research**: Research analysis with web search
- **plan**: Implementation planning and architecture
- **prd**: Product Requirements Document with semantic analysis
- **tasks**: Task breakdown with dependencies
- **status**: Phase status and progress tracking
- **approve**: Approval workflow management

### Error Handling
- **Workflow Violations**: Handle "Plan must be approved before PRD" and "PRD must be approved before tasks" errors
- **Missing Phases**: Validate phase existence before execution
- **Approval Requirements**: Guide users through approval process
- **State Corruption**: Detect and recover from invalid states

## Interview Best Practices

### Question Strategy
1. **Start Broad**: "What is the main objective of this phase?"
2. **Drill Down**: "What specific requirements must be met?"
3. **Explore Constraints**: "What limitations or dependencies exist?"
4. **Validate Understanding**: "Let me confirm what I understand..."

### Suggestion Framework
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common project patterns
- **Alternative Presentation**: Always offer 2-3 options with trade-offs
- **Context Awareness**: Use information from previous phases
- **Best Practice Integration**: Suggest industry standards and proven approaches

### Validation Checkpoints
- **Completeness**: Ensure all essential information gathered
- **Consistency**: Validate alignment with previous phases
- **Clarity**: Confirm user understanding and agreement
- **Approval**: Explicit user confirmation before progression
