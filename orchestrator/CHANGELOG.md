- **Performance-First**: Enterprise-grade performance validation throughout development
- **Real-World Validation**: Tested with actual audio processing workflows

## Breaking Changes
None - this is the initial production release.

## Deprecations
None - all APIs are stable and production-ready.

## Security
- No security vulnerabilities identified in production validation
- Safe handling of user input and file operations
- Schema validation prevents malformed data injection
- Error isolation prevents information leakage

## Known Issues
None - all identified issues resolved during development and testing phases.
